# FAQ

#### Is the elowo API stable?

- Elowo is still a young project and there are plenty of ideas how it will evolve in the future.
  While we therefore cannot give you a guarantee that there won't ever be any incompatible changes,
  we have done our best to make the current API future-proof. If there will be a need for an
  incompatible change, we will clearly communicate it and most probably only trivial changes will be
  required to your code.

#### How can I report an issue

- Please use [Github issue tracking](https://github.com/eludi/elowo/issues) for this.

#### Which browsers are supported?

- Elowo relies on APIs that have only recently been added to the living HTML5 standard
  (e.g, service workers, cache API). Due to that, the browser needs to be fairly modern.
  Elowo is regularly tested on the most recent versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome
  (desktop and mobile), Microsoft Edge, Web/Epiphany, and Apple Mobile Safari.

#### What about Mac support?

- We test on Web/Epiphany (which uses the same WebKit browser engine as Safari) and iOS Mobile Safari,
  so we hope to indirectly cover maybe 98 percent of macOS Safari as well.
  But we do not own a Mac, so unfortunately we cannot regularly test elowo on it. So if you encounter
  issues (most probably when using the Safari browser), please report them to us, ideally with
  a suggestion how to fix them. In the meanwhile please try a different browser such as Firefox or
  Chrome.

#### What does elowo mean?

  - The name is a fictive Pidgin derivation from elowo < *helloworld. This is the classic name
    of the introductory first textbook example when learning a new programming language.
